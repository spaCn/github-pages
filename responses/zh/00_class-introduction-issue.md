## 第一步: 开通 GitHub Pages

欢迎您来到 GitHub Pages 和 Jekyll 的世界 :tada:!

If you're new to GitHub Pages, or you want to learn how to build and host a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site, you're in the right place. With GitHub Pages, you can host content like [documentation](https://flight-manual.atom.io/), [resumes](https://github.com/jglovier/resume-template), or any other static content that you’d like.

In this course, you'll create a blog hosted on GitHub Pages and learn how to:

- Enable GitHub Pages
- Use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator
- Customize Jekyll sites with a theme and content

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host }}/courses/introduction-to-github).

### :keyboard: Activity: Generate a GitHub Pages site

The first step to publishing your blog to the web is to enable GitHub Pages on this repository <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#repository)</sup>. When you enable GitHub Pages on a repository, GitHub takes the content that's on the main branch and publishes a website based on its contents.

1. Under your repository name, click [**Settings**]({{ repoUrl }}/settings).
1. In the "GitHub Pages" section, in the Source drop-down, select **main branch**.

After GitHub Pages is enabled and the site is started, we'll be ready to create some more content. 

> Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.
