## Step 4: Customize Site Details

Great work! You can see your published page [here]({{ deploymentUrl }}). If you don't see your changes right away, refresh the page.

### Getting your page blog ready

Jekyll uses a file titled `_config.yml` to store settings for your site, your theme, and reusable content like your site title and GitHub handle.

You can check out the `_config.yml` file on the **Code** tab of your repository.

### :keyboard: Activity: Modify the config file

Let's change the `_config.yml` so it's a perfect fit for your new blog. First, we need to use a blog-ready theme. For this activity, we will use a theme named `minima`.

1. Navigate to the **Code** tab of this repository, and browse to the `_config.yml` file, or click this link [here]({{ repoUrl }}/blob/main/_config.yml).
2. In the upper right corner, click :pencil2: to open the file editor.
3. Add a `theme:` set to **minima** so it shows in the `_config.yml` file as below:
    ```
    theme: minima
    ```
4. Modify the other configuration variables such as `title:`, `author:`, and `description:` to customize your site.
5. Click **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
6. Open a pull request.
