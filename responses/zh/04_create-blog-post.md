:warning: Do not merge yet! :warning:

This pull request looks great so far. :sparkles: You've just edited the `_config.yml` file! We have some more work to do to create your blog site. You can continue to make commits on your `{{ branch }}` branch and the pull request will update automatically.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add some content to your blog

**Shortcut Note**: Click [this link]({{ repoUrl }}/new/{{ branch }}/?filename=_posts/{{ date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}-my-first-blog-post.md) to automatically complete steps 1-4.

1. On the "Code" tab, select your `{{ branch }}` branch.
1. Click **Create new file**.
1. Name the file `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
1. Replace the `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date, and change the `title` of your first blog post if you'd like. _Note:_ If you do edit the title, make sure there are hyphens between your words.

   - If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "[Page build failed: Invalid post date](https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-invalid-post-date/)".

1. Type a quick draft of your blog post. Remember, you can always edit it later.
1. Commit your changes to your branch.
