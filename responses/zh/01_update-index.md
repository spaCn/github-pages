## Step 2: Customize your homepage

Great job! Now that GitHub Pages is enabled, you can view your website here: {{ deploymentUrl }}

You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an `index` file or the `README.md` file. GitHub Pages first looks for an `index` file. If an `index` file is found, GitHub Pages uses the content in the file to create the homepage. If an `index` file isnâ€™t found, it uses the `README.md` to create the homepage.

Your repository has an `index.md` file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

### :keyboard: Activity: Create your homepage
